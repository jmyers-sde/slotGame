# Jelly Bean Casino #
First of all this is supposed to be a demo game of penny slots. It is supposed to be a teaser to an online Casino that is under construction. The game starts with the index.html. You can sign up for an e-mail to let you know when the sight is finished and you get a week free if you sign up for the alert now. There is a quick about link that has a quick mission statment of what the company is about. 

You can click play and it will take you to the slotmachine.html. The slot machine game will start you out wit 500 credits and will start with background sound. There is also sound affects and you have the option to turn both of those off with buttons at the top of the machine. There is three different betting buttons and a spin button. You can use the keyboard instead for these which there is tool tips to tell you and an info page in the menu drop down button to inform you of this feature. If you get into the thousands of credits I have put a regex code in to insert commas for an easier read of your credits. If you get a jackpot there will be modal display pop up to let you know. If you lose all your money this a modal will pop up to let you know as well and will let you reset the game. If you get below 250 credits there is a code that allows you to win 30% of the time so that you will feel more enticed to play. The rows light up when you win and sounds play for winning, lost all credits, jackpot, spin, and background noise. 

This is going to be developed later into a full blown casino website that plays with imagainary money. But the demo and promise of an upcoming website is my capstone. Thank you.

p.s. I added an automatic Jackpot function so that you may view the function without having to play the game. You must first place a bet and then press the letter R key and you will automatically get a jackpot.
